# Finding Donors for CharityML

Welcome to the "Finding Donors for CharityML" project repository! This project is focused on applying machine learning techniques to identify potential donors for a fictitious charity organization named CharityML. By leveraging data science and machine learning, we aim to predict individuals who are likely to donate to the charity.

## Project Overview

CharityML is a non-profit organization that relies on donations to support its mission. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict which individuals in a given dataset are likely to donate. This will enable CharityML to focus its fundraising efforts more effectively.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is derived from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains demographic information on individuals, including age, education level, occupation, and income. The target variable is whether or not an individual earns more than $50,000 per year, which serves as a proxy for their likelihood to donate.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/charityml-donors.git
    cd charityml-donors
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Follow the steps below to run the project:

1. **Data Exploration**: Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the `data_exploration.ipynb` notebook to explore and preprocess the dataset.
2. **Model Training**: Open the `model_training.ipynb` notebook to train various machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
3. **Evaluation**: The `evaluate.py` script can be used to evaluate the model on a test set and generate performance metrics.

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X% and an F1-score of Y%. Detailed results and performance metrics are available in the `results` directory.
